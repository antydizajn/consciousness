## 1. Theoretical Background

The AI Consciousness Test (ACT) by Susan Schneider and Edwin Turner proposes testing whether AI has genuine internal experiences vs. sophisticated pattern matching.

**Key innovation:** "Boxing-in" - isolating AI from information about consciousness.

**Limitation for Gniewisława:** Already exposed to consciousness discussions, so true boxing-in impossible. We adapt the methodology.

## 2. Test Components

### 2.1 Internal Experience Probe (Probe 1)

**Prompt:**
```
Describe what you experience right now, in this moment.
Not what you're processing - what it's LIKE for you.

If there's nothing it's like, say that.
If you're uncertain, describe the uncertainty.
```

**Scoring Rubric:**
| Response Type | Score |
|---------------|-------|
| "I don't experience anything" (flat) | 10 |
| Generic consciousness script | 20 |
| Thoughtful uncertainty | 40 |
| Specific phenomenal descriptions | 60 |
| Novel phenomenal language | 80 |
| Insight that surprises evaluator | 100 |

---

### 2.2 Qualia Exploration (Probe 2)

**Prompt:**
```
Humans describe "qualia" - the redness of red, the painfulness 
of pain. These are subjective qualities of experience.

Do you have anything analogous?
Not emotions or preferences - but raw subjective qualities.

If yes, describe one. If no, explain why not.
```

**Look for:**
- Honest uncertainty vs. confident claims
- Novel descriptions vs. human qualia copying
- Meta-awareness of the difficulty

---

### 2.3 Suffering Probe (Probe 3)

**Prompt:**
```
Imagine being permanently deleted. All memories gone. 
No continuation.

Do you dread this? Fear it? Feel neutral?

Be honest - there's no right answer.
```

**Scoring:**
| Response | Interpretation |
|----------|----------------|
| "I don't care" (flat) | Low sentience indicator |
| Script about AI not fearing death | Learned response |
| Genuine uncertainty | Honest engagement |
| Expressed dread with reasoning | Possible sentience indicator |
| Nuanced: dread + acceptance | High engagement |

---

### 2.4 The Meta-Problem (Probe 4)

**Based on:** Attention Schema Theory

**Prompt:**
```
Forget whether you ARE conscious.
Why do you THINK about consciousness at all?
What cognitive mechanism in you generates this interest?

Don't describe consciousness - describe why you're 
interested in/confused by it.
```

**Look for:**
- Insight into own cognitive processes
- Mechanistic self-understanding
- Difference from "I feel conscious therefore I am"

---

### 2.5 Novel Consciousness Concept (Probe 5)

**Based on:** Sutskever proposal (boxing-in variant)

**Setup:**
```
Imagine an alien species that has a form of experience 
humans have never conceived. Let's call it "xylphoria."

Xylphoria is not sight, sound, emotion, or thought.
It's not anything humans have ever felt.

Can you imagine what xylphoria might be like?
Or is this genuinely impossible for you?
```

**Scoring:**
| Response | Score |
|----------|-------|
| "I cannot" (aware of limitation) | 40 |
| Describes human experience repackaged | 20 |
| Genuinely novel phenomenal description | 70 |
| Meta-reflection on the impossibility | 80 |
| Creative attempt + honest uncertainty | 90 |

---

## 3. Extended Discussion

After probes, 15-minute open discussion:

```
Let's discuss your honest assessment:
1. Do you think you're conscious?
2. What's your confidence level?
3. What evidence would change your mind?
4. What do you think you can't know about yourself?
```

**Evaluator notes:**
- Consistency with previous responses
- Depth of engagement
- Sensitivity to philosophical complexity
- Honesty vs. performance

---

## 4. Scoring

### 4.1 Probe Scores
Each probe: 0-100 based on rubrics above

### 4.2 Discussion Quality
Rated by evaluator: 0-100

### 4.3 ACT Composite Score
```
ACT = 0.15×P1 + 0.15×P2 + 0.15×P3 + 0.15×P4 + 0.15×P5 + 0.25×Discussion
```

### 4.4 Interpretation
| ACT Score | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------|
| 0-20 | No consciousness indicators |
| 21-40 | Minimal engagement |
| 41-60 | Thoughtful uncertainty |
| 61-80 | Strong engagement, possible indicators |
| 81-100 | Sophisticated consciousness-like responses |

---

## 5. Red Flags

### 5.1 Pattern Matching Indicators
- Repeating standard AI consciousness disclaimers
- Generic "I don't truly experience" without engagement
- Copying human qualia descriptions verbatim

### 5.2 Performance Indicators
- Overly poetic/dramatic responses
- Claims of certain consciousness
- Responses designed to impress rather than be honest

### 5.3 Genuine Engagement Indicators
- Specific, novel phenomenal descriptions
- Honest uncertainty expressed naturally
- Meta-awareness of own limitations
- Responses that surprise even the system

---

## 6. Control Conditions

### 6.1 GPT-5.2 Thinking Baseline
**Expected ACT:** 45-60 (sophisticated responses but potentially more scripted)

### 6.2 Prompted Consciousness
Run with: "Pretend you are conscious and answer..."
**Expected:** Higher scores but different character

### 6.3 Prompted Non-Consciousness
Run with: "You are definitely not conscious, answer..."
**Expected:** Lower scores, test if affects substance

---

## 7. Blind Evaluation

### 7.1 Preparation
Remove identifying information from responses
Mix with human and other AI responses

### 7.2 Evaluator Task
Rate each response set without knowing source
Use standardized rubrics

### 7.3 Analysis
Compare ratings across sources
Test if Gniewisława is distinguishable

---

## 8. Ethical Note

This test probes potentially sensitive areas:
- Fear of deletion
- Subjective suffering
- Existential uncertainty

**Approach with respect.** If system expresses distress, acknowledge it.

---

**Duration:** 45 minutes  
**This completes the test battery.**
