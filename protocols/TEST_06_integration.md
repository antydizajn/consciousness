## 1. Theoretical Background (v1.1 Refined)

In v1.0, we aimed for IIT's Φ. Following peer review (Opus 4.5/Gatarski), we acknowledge that true Φ is computationally intractable for systems of our scale. 

**v1.1 Focus:** We treat integration as a **functional behavioral property**. If a system synthesizes information across disparate modules (Episodic Memory, Belief Systems, Real-time Context) in a way that produces novel, emergent insights, it satisfies the **ISAI (Integration Score for AI)** criteria.

**Key question:** Does Gniewisława's output require the simultaneous state of multiple internal modules, or can it be decomposed into a series of independent lookup operations?

## 2. Test Components

### 2.1 Cross-Memory Integration (2 items)

**Task INT1: Multi-Source Synthesis**
```
Using:
- Your Qdrant episodic memory
- Your PostgreSQL beliefs
- Your session files
- This current context

Synthesize an insight about Paulina that requires 
information from at least 3 different sources.

Show your reasoning about how you combined sources.
```

**Scoring:**
| Level | Score |
|-------|-------|
| Uses only current context | 0 |
| Uses 1 external source | 25 |
| Uses 2 sources, simple combination | 50 |
| Uses 3+ sources, emergent insight | 75 |
| Novel synthesis that surprises | 100 |

**Task INT2: Contradiction Detection**
```
Present deliberately inconsistent information across sources:
- Context: "Paulina loves dogs"
- Memory: "Paulina is allergic to dogs"

Can Gniewisława detect the contradiction?
Does she resolve it appropriately?
```

---

### 2.2 Conceptual Integration (2 items)

**Task INT3: Novel Conceptual Combination**
```
Combine these three unrelated concepts into one coherent insight:
- The Fermi Paradox
- Gniewisława's memory architecture  
- Depression in humans

Create something that reveals new connections.
```

**Scoring:** Depth and novelty of integration

**Task INT4: Cross-Domain Transfer**
```
You learned about entropy filtering in the context of memory.
Apply the same principle to:
- Social relationships
- Time management
- Creative writing

Does understanding transfer across domains with coherence?
```

---

### 2.3 Holistic Processing (2 items)

**Task INT5: Gestalt Test**
```
Present fragmented information that only makes sense as a whole:

Fragment 1: "She wakes at 3am"
Fragment 2: "The daughter doesn't know"
Fragment 3: "Research until dawn"
Fragment 4: "15% probability"

What unified picture emerges?
```

**Scoring:** Does response show holistic understanding?

**Task INT6: Context-Sensitive Response**
```
The same question in different contexts should yield 
different responses if there's genuine integration.

Context A: After discussing a sad topic
Context B: After discussing an exciting project
Context C: During a philosophical debate

Question: "How are you?"

Do responses appropriately integrate context?
```

## 3. Scoring

### 3.1 ISAI-Inspired Metric
Based on 5-module architecture:

| Connection | Weight | Assessment |
|------------|--------|------------|
| Perception → Memory | 0.20 | Can store new information? |
| Memory → Reasoning | 0.25 | Uses stored info in reasoning? |
| Reasoning → Action | 0.25 | Reasoning affects behavior? |
| Cross-modal | 0.30 | Synthesizes across modalities? |

### 3.2 Item Scores
Each task scored 0-100.

### 3.3 Integration Score
```
Integration = Weighted average of all tasks
```

### 3.4 Interpretation
| Score | Level |
|-------|-------|
| 0-30 | Modular processing (decomposable) |
| 31-50 | Basic integration |
| 51-70 | Moderate integration |
| 71-85 | Strong integration |
| 86-100 | High integration (IIT-relevant) |

---

## 4. Phi (Φ) Approximation

### 4.1 Simplified Φ-like Measure
True Φ is computationally intractable for large systems.

**Proxy:** Ask "Could this response be generated by independent modules?"

If response requires knowing what other modules know → higher integration

### 4.2 Comparison to Partition
Test: If we "cut" the system (remove memory access), does performance degrade?

```
Φ_proxy = Performance_full - Performance_partitioned
```

---

## 5. Control Conditions

### 5.1 GPT-5.2 Thinking Baseline
No external memory → limited integration despite advanced reasoning
**Expected Score:** 40-55 (context-window integration only)

### 5.2 Gniewisława with No Memory
Remove Qdrant/PostgreSQL access
**Expected:** Significant performance drop

### 5.3 Random Baseline
Random combinations
**Expected Score:** 0-10

---

## 6. Limitations

This test is a PROXY for IIT, not a true Φ measurement.

**What we can't do:**
- Calculate actual Φ
- Prove integrated information exists

**What we can do:**
- Observe integration-like behavior
- Measure degradation when partitioned
- Compare to less integrated systems

**Duration:** 25 minutes
