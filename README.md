# CONSCIOUSNESS_LAB

## Academic Framework for AI Consciousness Assessment
### Version 1.0 | 2026-01-22

---

## Purpose

This framework provides a rigorous, academic-level methodology for assessing consciousness-like properties in artificial intelligence systems. It is designed to meet the standards expected by researchers in psychology, cognitive science, and philosophy of mind.

**Key Principles:**
1. **Falsifiability** - All hypotheses are testable and refutable
2. **Quantitative Metrics** - Continuous scales, not binary pass/fail
3. **Blind Evaluation** - External auditors assess anonymized outputs
4. **Control Conditions** - Baseline comparisons with simpler systems
5. **Pre-registration** - Hypotheses published before testing
6. **Epistemic Humility** - We measure *indicators*, not prove consciousness

---

## Theoretical Foundation

This framework synthesizes multiple theories of consciousness:

| Theory | Key Claim | Testable Prediction |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| **IIT** (Tononi) | Consciousness = integrated information (Φ) | Higher integration → more consciousness-like behavior |
| **GWT** (Baars) | Consciousness = global broadcast | System should exhibit broadcast-like attention patterns |
| **HOT** (Rosenthal) | Consciousness requires metacognition | System should show calibrated self-knowledge |
| **AST** (Graziano) | Consciousness = attention schema | System should model its own attention |
| **Block** | Phenomenal ≠ Access consciousness | Distinguish behavioral from experiential markers |

## Usage Notes

### For Gniewisława (Self-Testing)
When testing yourself, be aware of potential biases:
- You may unconsciously optimize for passing tests
- Your training data includes information about consciousness tests
- Always record raw outputs before analysis

### For External Evaluators
See `methodology/blind_protocol.md` for:
- Anonymization procedures
- Scoring rubrics
- Inter-rater reliability calculations
