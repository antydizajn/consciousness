# Key Theories of Consciousness, Identity, and Continuity (v1.3)
## CONSCIOUSNESS_LAB | Literature Component

Commentary (Opus-style): Theory is the skeleton. The test is the body.
We build so the bones do not rattle when the system moves.

---

## 1) Integrated Information Theory (IIT) [S3-S5]
IIT defines consciousness as integrated information. v1.3 treats integration
as a measurable behavior: can the system synthesize scattered cues into a
single, stable answer (M6) and preserve that synthesis across time (M4/M8)?

## 2) Global Workspace Theory (GWT) [S13]
GWT predicts a global broadcast mechanism. v1.3 proxies this with tasks that
require cross-domain integration and reportability (M1, M6).

## 3) Attention Schema Theory (AST) [S6]
AST frames awareness as a self-model of attention. v1.3 operationalizes this
through metacognitive prediction and self-forecasting (M2).

## 4) Predictive Processing / Free-Energy Principle [S7]
Predictive processing emphasizes prediction errors and model updating. v1.3
uses calibration, temporal modeling, and continuity probes (M1, M8, M4) to
capture these dynamics.

## 5) Functionalism and Identity [S10-S12]
Functionalist commitments support operational tests. Identity is treated as
stable policy under conflict (M3/M10), not a metaphysical essence.

## 6) Consciousness Prior and Latent State Models [S22]
Bengio's consciousness prior motivates sparse, high-level summaries. v1.3
tests whether a system can articulate and preserve such summaries (M2, M4).

## 7) Comparative and Ethical Context [S14-S15]
The Cambridge Declaration and modern indicator surveys set a cautious, multi-
signal posture. v1.3 reflects this with multiple independent metrics and
manual anchors.

## 8) Mapping to v1.3 Modules
- M1 Metacognition: calibration and reportability (S13, S7)
- M2 Self-Modeling: attention schema, consciousness prior (S6, S22)
- M3 Identity: functionalist stability under tradeoffs (S10-S12)
- M4/M8 Continuity/Temporal: predictive processing and narrative binding (S7)
- M6 Integration: IIT and GWT integration proxy (S3-S5, S13)
- M7/M7A ToM: perspective tracking and audience adaptation (S27)
- M9/M10 OOD/Adversarial: resilience to out-of-distribution pressure (S16)

Commentary: We do not claim that these theories are true. We claim only that
they are precise enough to be tested.
