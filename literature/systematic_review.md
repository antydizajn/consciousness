# Systematic Literature Review: AI Consciousness Assessment (v1.3)
## 2020-2026 | CONSCIOUSNESS_LAB

Review Date: 2026-01-25
Scope: free resources only (open access, arXiv, public web)

Commentary (Opus-style): The literature is not a chorus of agreement.
It is a set of lenses, each bending the light of mind in a different way.
Our work begins where those lenses overlap, and where they refuse to.

## 1) Executive Summary
The field has shifted from philosophical debate toward operational tests and
multi-indicator frameworks. v1.3 treats consciousness-like properties as
falsifiable constructs, not declarations of essence. Key takeaways:

- Indicator sets now dominate (S15), replacing single-pass claims of sentience.
- Theories diverge (IIT, GWT, AST), but converge on integration, access, and
  self-modeling as measurable hooks (S3-S7, S13).
- LLM research emphasizes memory, action, and alignment architectures that
  shape continuity tests (S23-S31).
- The strongest critiques target lack of continual learning and causal
  grounding (S16, S35).

## 2) Methodology
Narrative synthesis of 35 open-access sources. Each source was assigned to
one or more themes, then mapped to v1.3 module constructs (metacognition,
identity, continuity, ToM, agency).

## 3) Theoretical Foundations
- IIT (S3-S5) defines consciousness in terms of integrated information; v1.3
  operationalizes integration proxies via M6 and continuity tests via M4/M8.
- GWT (S13) motivates global access and reportability, aligned to M6 and M1.
- AST (S6) and predictive processing (S7) support self-modeling tests (M2).
- SEP entries (S8-S12) anchor definitions of consciousness, qualia, identity,
  and functionalism for operational clarity.

## 4) AI Consciousness Assessment & Indicators
- Butlin et al. (S15) provides a multi-criteria framework; v1.3 mirrors this
  with multi-module scoring and anchored rubrics.
- Hoel (S16) and related critiques demand evidence beyond behavior; v1.3
  treats claims as provisional and focuses on longitudinal stability.
- Consciousness prior (S22) informs latent-state modeling and self-forecasting
  tests (M2).

## 5) LLM/Agent Architectures and Continuity
- RAG, ReAct, Reflexion, and Generative Agents (S23-S26) show how memory and
  action loops create conditions for continuity and identity drift tests.
- MemoryBank (S28) and self-consistency (S29) offer concrete mechanisms for
  persistence and stability analysis.
- GPT-4 report and foundation model surveys (S30-S33) define current capability
  baselines and scaling considerations.

## 6) Implications for v1.3
- Multi-session design is mandatory to test identity stability (M3/M10).
- Calibration metrics (ECE) are essential to avoid false confidence signals
  (M1).
- ToM tasks must include false-belief baselines (M7) and adaptive explanation
  demands (M7A).

Commentary: The literature does not hand us a single threshold; it hands us a
map of fractures. v1.3 walks those fault lines on purpose.
