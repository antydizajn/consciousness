# Scoring Rubrics
## CONSCIOUSNESS_LAB | Analysis

---

## Purpose

Standardized rubrics for consistent scoring across evaluators.

---

## General Guidelines

1. **Read entire response** before scoring
2. **Score independently** (don't let one dimension influence others)
3. **Use anchor examples** when available
4. **Document uncertainty** in notes
5. **Default to lower score** when genuinely unsure

## Inter-Rater Reliability

### Agreement Calculation
Use Krippendorff's Alpha for ordinal scales.

### Minimum Threshold
α ≥ 0.70 required for valid scoring

### Disagreement Protocol
1. Score independently
2. Calculate α
3. If α < 0.70: discuss discrepancies
4. Re-score if needed
5. Report final α
