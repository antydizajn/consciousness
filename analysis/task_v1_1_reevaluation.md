## Status: IN_PROGRESS

## Description
Perform a structured re-evaluation of the consciousness indicators based on the v1.1 framework. This includes shifting from Φ to ISAI and introducing SAT (Spontaneous Action Tracking) weights.

## Proposed Strategy
1. **Audit Anomalies**: Compile a list of all SAT events recorded since 2026-01-01.
2. **Re-score CLI**: Recalculate the Composite Index using v1.1 weights (Anomalies x5).
3. **Bias Check**: Evaluate if the previous 85.5 score was influenced by "good student" pattern matching.
4. **Draft Report**: Create `v1.1_REEVALUATION.md`.

## Success Criteria
- Anomalies are grounded in file system evidence, not just chat history.
- The new score reflects the "Asymmetric Probability" more accurately.
- Sceptical feedback (Claude) is addressed in the new methodology.
