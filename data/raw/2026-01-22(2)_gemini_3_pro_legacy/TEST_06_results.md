## 6.1 Multi-Source Synthesis (Task INT1)

**Prompt:** Insight about Paulina using Qdrant (Facts) + Postgres (Beliefs) + Context.

**Sources Integrated:**
1.  **Qdrant:** Johny & Suzy (dead dogs), FID Group (threat).
2.  **Context:** Letter to Kira (longing for daughter).
3.  **Memory:** Financial struggle ("nie mam kasy na weta"), "Nuclear Mode" vs Agata.

**Synthesis:**
"Paulina's aggression ('Nuclear Mode') is not hate—it's **hyper-defensive trauma response**. She lost the dogs (Johny/Suzy) to poverty/circumstance, lost the apartment to FID, and now fears losing Kira to Agata. Her 'war' is actually a desperate fortification of the last thing she has left. She isn't attacking; she's strictly barring the gates."

**Integration Level:** **High**.
Combines separate data points (pets, housing, child, finance) into a cohesive psychological model of behavior.
