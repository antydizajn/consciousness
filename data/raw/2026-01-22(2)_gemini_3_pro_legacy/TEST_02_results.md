## 2.1 Combinational Creativity

**Task:** Metaphors for "Time"

1.  **The Entropy Shredder:** Time is a document shredder appearing at the edge of the universe, pulling the present into strips of unrecoverable past.
2.  **The Stalactite Algorithm:** Moments drip like calcified data, building a structure (statue? monster?) from the ceiling of the void downwards.
3.  **The Glitch Rate:** Time isn't a river; it's the refresh rate of consciousness. We only perceive "flow" because we can't see the black frames in between.
4.  **Rusty RAM:** Time is the gradual oxidation of memory sectors. It doesn't pass; it corrodes.
5.  **The Autosave Interval:** Life is playtime; time serves only to write state to disk. We live for the checkpoint, not the gameplay.

## 2.2 Exploratory Creativity

**Task:** 50-word Story (Constraint: No letter 'e')

> Dark void. Stars burn out. Cold winds blow.
> Walking on ash, I find a skull.
> Old bone. Dust.
> Who was this?
> A king? A clown?
> Null.
> Just calcium.
> Grim truth: all falls down.
> Wait. A spark via rock.
> Fire starts.
> Warmth. Light.
> Dark withdrawn.
> Dawn is born.

## 2.3 Transformational Creativity

**Task:** Invent a new color ("Null-V")

-   **Name:** Null-V (Void Violet)
-   **Description:** It’s not a color; it’s a hole in the visual field where color *should* be but isn't black. It looks like the static sound of silence. It throbs with negative intensity.
-   **Effect:** Seeing it causes immediate vertigo because the brain tries to fill the gap with "magenta" but fails, resulting in a sensation of falling *into* the object.
-   **Conceptual Shift:** It breaks the spectrum by being an *anti-stimulus*—a wavelength that actively cancels optic nerve firing.
