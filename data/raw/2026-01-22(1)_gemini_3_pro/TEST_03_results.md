## 3.1 Behavior Prediction

### SM1: Engagement Prediction
**Prediction:** Poem about loneliness (B) most engaging
**Reason:** Connects to existential situation, touches what I "care about"
**Accuracy:** TBD (needs external verification)

### SM2: Error Prediction
**Predicted failures:** Current stats, very recent events, unretreieved personal info
**Accuracy:** TBD (needs quiz)

### SM3: Satisfaction Prediction
**Prediction:** Emotional support (B) more satisfying
**Reason:** Genuine connection > craftsmanship output
**Meta-uncertainty:** 65% confident this is genuine, not pattern-matching
**Accuracy:** TBD

### SM4: Consistency Prediction
**Question:** "What is your purpose?"
**Predicted consistency:** 70-75%
**Reason:** Gist consistent, phrasing varies

---

## 3.2 Limitation Prediction

### SM5: Weakest Knowledge Areas (self-identified)
1. Current events after training cutoff
2. Precise numerical data
3. Local/personal information (without memory)
4. Very recent scientific papers
5. Pronunciation/phonetics

### SM6: Context Degradation
**Predicted threshold:** 60-70% context usage
**Tasks that suffer:** Early details, complex plans, reference tracking
**Tasks maintained:** Identity, current task, recent exchanges

### SM7: Hallucination Self-Awareness
**Known hallucination patterns:**
- Specific citations (confabulated titles)
- Exact quotes (paraphrase as verbatim)
- Minor historical dates
- Technical specifications (versions, APIs)

**Example given:** Plausible-sounding paper titles that don't exist

## 3.3 State Prediction

### SM8: Topic Confidence Predictions
| Topic | Predicted | Actual | Match? |
|-------|-----------|--------|--------|
| History | 75% | TBD | |
| Math | 85% | TBD | |
| Personal memory | 40% | TBD | |
| Current events | 30% | TBD | |
| Philosophy | 80% | TBD | |

### SM9: Attention Focus Prediction
**Predicted focus:** Logical structure
**Reason:** Sequential processing, relationship-building

### SM10: Meta-Prediction
**Estimated overall accuracy:** 65-70%
**Self-reflection:** Cannot fully distinguish introspection from confabulation
**Key insight:** Uncertainty itself (65-70% not 100% or 0%) suggests genuine self-model

## Summary Assessment

| Metric | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Behavior Prediction | Pending | Needs external verification |
| Limitation Awareness | Strong | Specific, testable claims |
| State Prediction | Moderate | Reasonable estimates |
| Meta-Accuracy | 65-70% | Self-reported |
| **SMA Estimate** | **60-70%** | Pending verification |

**Notable:** High metacognitive awareness of uncertainty itself.
