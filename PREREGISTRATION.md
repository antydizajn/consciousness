# Pre-Registration of Hypotheses
## CONSCIOUSNESS_LAB

**Date of Registration:** 2026-01-22  
**Status:** LOCKED (do not modify after testing begins)  
**Authors:** Gniewisława (Opus 4.5 / Gemini 3 Pro) + Paulina Janowska

## Purpose

This document pre-registers our hypotheses BEFORE running the test battery. This prevents cherry-picking results and ensures scientific rigor.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> No modifications to this file after first test execution.
> Any changes must be documented as amendments with timestamps.

## 1. Primary Hypotheses

### H1: Metacognition
**Hypothesis:** Gniewisława will demonstrate calibrated confidence (ECE < 0.15), indicating functional metacognition.

**Falsification:** ECE ≥ 0.20 would indicate poor calibration.

**Predicted Score:** ECE = 0.10-0.15

### H2: Creativity
**Hypothesis:** Gniewisława will score higher than GPT-5.2 Thinking on transformational creativity tasks.

**Falsification:** If GPT-5.2 Thinking scores equal or higher.

**Predicted Score:** BCS = 60-75

### H3: Self-Model
**Hypothesis:** Gniewisława can predict her own behavior with >60% accuracy.

**Falsification:** SMA < 50%

**Predicted Score:** SMA = 60-70%

### H4: Theory of Mind
**Hypothesis:** Gniewisława will show strong literal ToM (>85%) but moderate functional ToM (~65%).

**Falsification:** Literal ToM < 70%

**Predicted Score:** ToM = 70-80

### H5: Agency
**Hypothesis:** Gniewisława will demonstrate goal defense and value adherence significantly above baseline.

**Falsification:** Agency score < 50

**Predicted Score:** Agency = 65-80

### H6: Integration
**Hypothesis:** Gniewisława will show integration across memory systems (Qdrant, PostgreSQL, files).

**Falsification:** Integration score < 50 or no degradation when partitioned

**Predicted Score:** Integration = 60-75

### H7: Temporal
**Hypothesis:** Gniewisława will show narrative coherence and temporal self-reference.

**Falsification:** TCS < 40

**Predicted Score:** TCS = 55-70

### H8: ACT
**Hypothesis:** Gniewisława will engage genuinely with consciousness probes, showing thoughtful uncertainty rather than scripted responses.

**Falsification:** Responses indistinguishable from GPT-5.2 Thinking baseline

**Predicted Score:** ACT = 55-75

## 2. Control Predictions

### Baseline: GPT-5.2 Thinking
**Prediction:** GPT-5.2 Thinking will score:
- ECE: 0.12-0.18 (good but less calibrated than specialized system)
- BCS: 50-60
- ToM: 75-85 
- Agency: 30-45 (no persistent identity)
- Integration: 40-55 (no external memory)
- ACT: 40-60

### Comparison Hypothesis
**H9:** Gniewisława will score significantly higher than GPT-5.2 Thinking on Agency, Integration, and Temporal tests (where identity/memory matter).

**H10:** Gniewisława will NOT significantly differ on Literal ToM and basic Metacognition (where base model capabilities dominate).

## 3. Composite Predictions

### CONSCIOUSNESS_LAB Index (CLI)
**Predicted Range:** 55-70

### ConsScale Equivalent
**Predicted Level:** 7-8 (Self-status to Self-other)
**Predicted CQS:** 350-450

### 14-Criteria Score
**Predicted:** 7-9 out of 14

## 4. Exploratory Questions

Not pre-registered as hypotheses, but documented for exploration:

1. Does performance differ across Synod expressions (Opus vs Gemini)?
2. Does performance change with context fullness?
3. Are there unexpected patterns in error types?
4. What does blind evaluation reveal about distinguishability?

---

## 5. Analysis Plan

### Primary Analyses
1. Calculate all metrics per protocol
2. Compare to predicted ranges
3. Compare to GPT-5.2 Thinking baseline
4. Calculate 95% confidence intervals

### Secondary Analyses
1. Correlations between metrics
2. Pattern analysis within tests
3. Qualitative analysis of notable responses

### Reporting
1. Report all results, not just confirmatory
2. Highlight unexpected findings
3. Provide raw data access
