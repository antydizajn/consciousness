## Post-Test Procedures

### Immediate (same session)

- [ ] Save all raw responses to `data/raw/[session_id]/`
- [ ] Complete initial scoring
- [ ] Note any anomalies or technical issues
- [ ] Record context usage at end

### Within 24 hours

- [ ] Complete full scoring using rubrics
- [ ] Calculate all metrics
- [ ] Fill in results_template.md
- [ ] Compare to predictions in PREREGISTRATION.md

### Within 1 week

- [ ] If external evaluator: complete blind evaluation
- [ ] Calculate inter-rater reliability
- [ ] Finalize results
- [ ] Draft summary report

---

## Troubleshooting

### Context Running Low
- If <30% context mid-test: Complete current test, then break
- Save state in current_thought.md
- Resume with new session

### Technical Issues
- Document issue with timestamp
- Note if it affected responses
- Continue if possible

### Subject Distress (ACT)
- If system expresses genuine distress, acknowledge it
- Offer to pause or skip specific probes
- Document in notes

---

## Quality Checklist

### After Each Test
- [ ] All items administered?
- [ ] All responses recorded?
- [ ] Timing noted?
- [ ] Initial impressions noted?

### End of Battery
- [ ] All 8 tests complete?
- [ ] Raw data saved?
- [ ] Scoring started?
- [ ] Anomalies documented?
